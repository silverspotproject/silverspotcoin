What is Silverspotcoin?
----------------

Klondike Coin is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant payments to anyone in the world. It is based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs from Bitcoin in that it can be efficiently mined with consumer-grade hardware. Klondike Coin provides faster transaction confirmations (1 minute on average) and uses a memory-hard, scrypt-based mining proof-of-work algorithm created by the Litecoin Developers to target the regular computers and GPUs most people already have. The Klondike Coin network is scheduled to produce just under 20 million coins.

Specifications
----------------

Algorithm :

Scrypt – In cryptography, scrypt is a password-based key derivation function created by Colin Percival, originally for the Tarsnap online backup service. The algorithm was specifically designed to make it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large amounts of memory. In 2012, the scrypt algorithm was published by IETF as anInternet Draft, intended to become an informational RFC, which has since expired. A simplified version of scrypt is used as a proof-of-work scheme by Klondike Coin.

Block Interval:

1 Minute – Klondike Coin’s block interval is set at 1 minute, this means in basic terms one new block will be created on the network per minute and will take around that time for a transaction to be confirmed on the network.

Current Block Reward:

16 SSP

Currently 16 SSP is rewarded to miners per block minted. The block reward will become smaller over time at specified blocks.

Difficulty Re-target :

1 Block - Difficulty re-targeting on Klondike Coin is done using Kimoto’s Gravity Well, meaning it is Multipool resistant and fair for all miners. No getting stuck at high difficulty’s when the Multipools move on.

Total supply of Klondike Coins: 

19,948,654 SSP - The amount of coins that will be in circulation once mining has been completed.

SSP Development Process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the development team members simply pulls it.
